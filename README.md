> **Scope and authorization**: Anti-API is an independent, unofficial interoperability project. Some integrations use provider CLI, web, or internal endpoints and may break without notice. Compatibility does not imply provider affiliation or endorsement. Use only accounts and services you own or are explicitly authorized to administer, subject to each provider's current terms. Do not disable security updates or provider controls to preserve compatibility.

## What's New (v3.2.0)

- **Provider compatibility and routing** - Improved Antigravity Gemini 3.1 request encoding, dynamic Copilot/model normalization, Codex reasoning-effort handling, and Responses API multimodal conversion for Zed, Codex, and Grok. Flow and account routes now preserve a sticky cursor and wrap through every eligible fallback entry.
- **Six supported providers** - Antigravity, ChatGPT Codex, GitHub Copilot, Zed hosted models, Amazon Kiro, and xAI Grok can be imported, listed, quota-checked, and routed from the dashboard (subject to each provider's current access and terms).
- **Multimodal input safety** - OpenAI `image_url` and Anthropic base64/remote image blocks are validated, size-bounded, SSRF-protected, and converted to provider-native inputs without dropping supported image parts.
- **Reliable OAuth and account flows** - Hardened PKCE/state validation, loopback callback handling, Antigravity client-version refresh with pin/disable overrides, explicit Zed credential import, and sanitized login/diagnostic errors.
- **Remote inference and Docker hardening** - The public listener is inference-only (default `8966`) and token-gated with `ANTI_API_PUBLIC_TOKEN`; the dashboard and management API remain loopback/token protected, including in container mode.
- **Windows packaging and Kiro support** - Added platform-safe browser launching, resilient `start.bat` behavior, portable/WinGet bundles with checksums, and Kiro tool/image/cancellation handling; removed obsolete macOS language-server probing.
- **Cancellation, limits, and log safety** - Propagated request aborts through routed providers, bounded request bodies and streams, applied cooldown-aware 404/429 failover, and removed upstream response bodies and credential material from logs.

Release verification covered the TypeScript check, 190 Bun tests, Rust tests and release build, production dashboard bundle, archive layout, checksum generation, and local HTTP smoke checks. Live provider calls still require credentials owned or administered by the operator.

## What's New (v3.1.0)

- **Grok provider support** - Added xAI Grok via the Grok CLI reverse proxy (`cli-chat-proxy.grok.com`, OpenAI Responses API), with account import, model routing, and quota-store integration alongside existing providers
- **Two Grok models exposed** - The standard ModelName `grok-build` (shown as **Xbuild**; this maps to the actual **Grok 4.3** model, as visible inside the Grok CLI) and `grok-composer-2.5-fast` (Composer 2.5 Fast)
- **Explicit credential import** - Grok can import an existing local CLI session after user action; no standalone login flow is added. Provider policy, quota, and account-enforcement decisions still apply.

<details>
<summary>v3.0.0</summary>

- **Kiro provider support** - Added Kiro account import, quota visibility, model routing, and reverse-proxy support alongside existing providers
- **Dashboard i18n** - Added global Chinese support, system-language default detection, and a Settings language switch
- **Account diagnostics assistant** - Added a localhost-only diagnostics panel for checking missing account files, CLI tools, callback ports, and provider setup
- **Panel updates** - Added a localhost-only update checker and source-install updater, with package-manager safeguards for WinGet and Docker
- **Docker support hardened** - Updated Docker defaults, OAuth port ranges, health checks, development compose separation, and Docker-specific update guidance

</details>

<details>
<summary>v2.9.0</summary>

- **Stable Homebrew package** - Homebrew now installs a prebuilt macOS Apple Silicon bundle, so `brew install anti-api` no longer depends on local Rust, LLVM, or Bun downloads
- **WinGet distribution pipeline** - Added Windows portable packaging, WinGet manifest generation, and release workflow for `winget install anti-api`
- **Unified launcher behavior** - Homebrew and WinGet installs now share the same contract: `anti-api` starts the service directly in any terminal
- **Portable runtime support** - Added a Windows portable entrypoint that starts the Rust proxy, serves the bundled dashboard files, and avoids package-manager self-update conflicts
- **Package-manager safeguards** - Homebrew/WinGet installs now redirect updates to `brew upgrade anti-api` and `winget upgrade anti-api` instead of self-overwriting

</details>

<details>
<summary>v2.8.0</summary>

- **Zed hosted-model support** - Anti-API can route authorized Zed-hosted accounts and models
- **Per-account dynamic model fetch** - Routing fetches live models from each available Codex and Copilot account, and now includes Zed account-level model sync
- **Zed account behavior clarified** - Zed accounts can be imported one by one and kept in Anti-API, but they cannot be bulk auto-discovered like Codex/Copilot
- **Zed quota widget updated** - The Zed card now shows shared all-model support status and billing-period timing instead of misleading remaining-credit percentages
- **Zed stability hardening** - Added request timeouts and success-state recovery for Zed account fetch, model sync, and completion requests

</details>

<details>
<summary>v2.7.1</summary>

- **Per-account model fetch (Routing)** - Model lists are now fetched from each logged-in Codex/Copilot account instead of relying on static presets
- **Antigravity fetch integration (single account)** - Routing now attempts live model fetch from the first available Antigravity account and falls back safely when unavailable
- **Account-level model map in `/routing/config`** - Added `accountModels` so the UI can render account-specific model lists directly
- **Routing panel model rendering update** - Account cards now show models from fetched account-level data first, then fallback models

</details>

<details>
<summary>v2.7.0</summary>

- **Antigravity policy notice** - This unofficial integration may conflict with current provider terms. Its presence in the codebase is not a representation that a particular use is permitted; verify the applicable terms before use.
- **Separate provider terms** - Codex and GitHub Copilot are governed by their own current terms. Anti-API makes no blanket claim that any provider integration is authorized or unaffected by policy changes.
- **Log IDE Out** - New one-click action to sign out of the Antigravity IDE (closes the IDE, clears auth, ready for a different account)

</details>

<details>
<summary>v2.6.2</summary>

- **Per-request log context isolation** - Error logs no longer mix model/account under concurrency
- **Copilot TLS hardening** - Default TLS verification restored; optional `ANTI_API_COPILOT_INSECURE_TLS=1` for restricted networks
- **Codex TLS hardening** - Default TLS verification restored; optional `ANTI_API_CODEX_INSECURE_TLS=1` for restricted networks
- **Routing config resilience** - Soft timeouts and caching for Copilot model sync and quota aggregation
- **Dynamic model sync** - Routing now syncs Codex/Copilot model lists from authenticated accounts with static fallback
- **Test baseline fixes** - `bun test ./test` avoids legacy folders; updated mocks and default settings

</details>

## Features

- **Flow + Account Routing** - Custom flows for non-official models, account chains for provider-native model IDs
- **Six Providers** - Antigravity, ChatGPT Codex, GitHub Copilot, Zed hosted models, Amazon Kiro, and xAI Grok
- **Remote Access** - ngrok/cloudflared/localtunnel with one-click setup
- **Inference-only public gateway** - Separate token-gated listener for remote clients; dashboard, credentials, logs, settings, and updater stay private
- **Full Dashboard** - Quota monitoring, routing config, settings panel
- **Cooldown-aware failover** - Sticky, circular account selection after quota, auth, 404, 429, or transient upstream failures
- **Dual Format** - OpenAI and Anthropic API compatible
- **Tool Calling** - Function calling for Claude Code and CLI tools
- **Multimodal requests** - Validated text, image, tool, and streaming content across compatible provider adapters

### Security boundary

The complete dashboard and management API bind to loopback by default. Remote access uses a separate inference-only listener (default `8966`) and requires `ANTI_API_PUBLIC_TOKEN`; tunnels never expose credentials, logs, settings, account management, or the updater. Credential imports are explicit by default and create local copies under `~/.anti-api`.

## Zed Account Notes

- **Explicit import only** - Set `ANTI_API_ZED_CREDENTIALS_FILE` to an absolute, owner-only JSON file, then click `Add Account -> Zed`. Anti-API does not inspect Zed.app, Keychain, or another application's database.
- **Credential format** - The file must be no larger than 64 KiB and contain `{"type":"zed","id":"...","access_token":"..."}`. Unknown fields are ignored; keep the file readable only by its owner (`chmod 600` on Unix).
- **Fixed services** - Imported accounts use the fixed Zed identity service at `https://zed.dev` and the fixed hosted API at `https://cloud.zed.dev`; request data cannot redirect either host.
- **Credential expiry** - Zed source access tokens are imported as-is. If a request returns `401` or `403`, update the credential file and use `Add Account -> Zed` to re-import it; Anti-API never scans or refreshes another application's credentials automatically.
- **Multiple accounts** - Switch accounts in Zed, export each authorized credential file, and import them one at a time. Imported accounts remain stored in Anti-API.
- **Quota monitor behavior** - Zed hosted models share one monthly spend pool across the account. Anti-API currently shows hosted access status and billing period, not exact remaining dollar credits.

## Quick Start

### Linux

```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

# Start server (default port: 8964)
bun run src/main.ts start
```

### Windows

Double-click `start.bat` to launch.
If startup fails, the window stays open so the error remains visible. Set `ANTI_API_NO_PAUSE=1` only for unattended scripts.

WinGet packaging is prepared in this repository. After the `winget-pkgs` submission is merged, the install path will be:

```powershell
winget install anti-api
anti-api
```

After installation, `anti-api` starts the service directly in any terminal.

### macOS

Double-click `start.command` to launch.

### Docker

Multi-arch images (`linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`) are published to GHCR, so most users never build locally.

#### Quick start (recommended)

Create a long random control-plane token before starting the container. The
dashboard and management API require this token even when the Docker port is
published only on localhost.

```bash
export ANTI_API_CONTROL_TOKEN='replace-with-a-long-random-secret'

docker run -d --name anti-api \
  -p 127.0.0.1:8964:8964 -p 127.0.0.1:1455-1465:1455-1465 -p 127.0.0.1:51121-51131:51121-51131 \
  -e ANTI_API_CONTAINER_CONTROL_PLANE=1 \
  -e ANTI_API_CONTROL_TOKEN="$ANTI_API_CONTROL_TOKEN" \
  -v anti-api-data:/app/data \
  ghcr.io/silasxbt/anti-api:latest
```

Or with Compose (pulls the prebuilt image, then runs in the background):

```bash
# Set ANTI_API_CONTROL_TOKEN in the shell or in a .env file first.
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

On **Windows**, set `$env:ANTI_API_CONTROL_TOKEN` to a long random value first, then run the same Docker command in PowerShell (use `$env:ANTI_API_CONTROL_TOKEN` in the `-e` argument). The named volume `anti-api-data` is managed by Docker, so there is no `$HOME`/path setup to get wrong.

#### First login (once)

The container can't read your local IDE credentials, so sign in via OAuth. To
bootstrap the browser session, open the dashboard once with the token query
parameter, for example `http://localhost:8964/quota?control_token=<your-token>`.
The server immediately removes the parameter and stores an HttpOnly cookie;
do not share or publish that URL.

1. After the one-time bootstrap redirect above, open the dashboard at <http://localhost:8964/quota>
2. Click **Login** for a provider:
   - **GitHub Copilot** — easiest in Docker: enter the shown device code at <https://github.com/login/device>.
   - **Antigravity / Codex** — the panel (and `docker logs anti-api`) prints an `Open this URL to login: ...` link. Open it in your browser; the callback returns to `localhost` and is captured by the mapped ports.
3. When the account appears on the dashboard, point your local client at `http://localhost:8964`. Local placeholder keys are accepted only for client compatibility; remote access requires `ANTI_API_PUBLIC_TOKEN`.

> You can also log in from a terminal: `docker compose exec anti-api bun run src/main.ts add-account`.

#### Ports

| Port range | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `8964` | Loopback control plane + local API |
| `8966` | Optional public inference gateway |
| `51121-51131` | Antigravity OAuth callback |
| `1455-1465` | Codex OAuth callback |

Copilot uses a device-code flow and needs no callback port.

#### Running on a remote host (NAS / VPS)

OAuth callbacks redirect to loopback (`127.0.0.1` by default), which won't reach a remote box from your laptop's browser. Either:

- use **Copilot** (device flow, no callback), or
- SSH-forward the ports: `ssh -L 8964:localhost:8964 -L 51121:localhost:51121 user@host`, then set `ANTI_API_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URL=http://127.0.0.1:51121/oauth-callback` on the server before starting the login flow.

An explicit `ANTI_API_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URL` binds exactly the loopback callback port in that URL. In Docker, the image uses a container-only callback relay (`ANTI_API_DOCKER_OAUTH_CALLBACK=1`) for Antigravity and Codex so a host-mapped loopback port can reach the container; the host port mappings above must remain bound to `127.0.0.1`. Public callback hosts are rejected: both flows bind callbacks to login state, and Antigravity also uses PKCE; do not publish callback ports on a public interface.

The complete control plane is loopback-only by default. For remote inference, expose only the separate public gateway with `ANTI_API_PUBLIC_TOKEN`; do not publish the dashboard, logs, settings, accounts, or updater.

#### Data & migration

Accounts and routing config live in the `anti-api-data` named volume. To **reuse data from a native install**, mount your host folder instead of the named volume in `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
    volumes:
      - ${HOME}/.anti-api:/app/data         # macOS / Linux
      # - ${USERPROFILE}/.anti-api:/app/data  # Windows
```

To import host provider credentials (Codex/AWS/Kiro/etc.) read-only, uncomment the example mounts in `docker-compose.yml`.

#### Development (hot reload)

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build
```

#### Notes

- Build locally instead of pulling: `docker compose up -d --build` (the image already ships the toolchain for the native `better-sqlite3` module).
- In-panel self-update is disabled in Docker; upgrade with `docker compose pull && docker compose up -d`.
- Restricted networks: `ANTI_API_COPILOT_INSECURE_TLS=1` / `ANTI_API_CODEX_INSECURE_TLS=1` bypass TLS verification (not recommended generally).
- `ANTI_API_CODEX_REASONING_EFFORT=low|medium|high` sets Codex default effort (default `medium`).
- Error-level logging is enabled by default. Set `ANTI_API_LOG_LEVEL=error|warn|info|debug` (or `ANTI_API_DEBUG=1`) to enable more detail; logs never include credential file contents.
- In containers and headless hosts, set `ANTI_API_NO_OPEN=1` or `ANTI_API_OAUTH_NO_OPEN=1` to skip browser launch. Browser opening uses native commands without a shell.
- Antigravity starts with a current client-version fallback and refreshes the public version manifest periodically. Set `ANTIGRAVITY_IDE_VERSION` to pin a known-good version, or `ANTI_API_DISABLE_ANTIGRAVITY_VERSION_REFRESH=1` to disable that check.
- Override the base image if a registry is slow: `BUN_IMAGE=oven/bun:1.3.5 docker compose build`.
- ngrok is bundled for Linux amd64/arm64.

## Smart Routing System (Beta)

> **Beta Feature**: Routing is experimental. Configuration may change in future versions.

The routing system is split into two modes:

- **Flow Routing**: Custom model IDs (e.g. `route:fast`) use your flow entries.
- **Account Routing**: Provider-native model IDs (e.g. `claude-sonnet-4-5`) use per-model account chains.

This enables fine-grained control over model-to-account mapping, allowing you to:

- **Load Balance**: Distribute requests across multiple accounts
- **Model Specialization**: Route specific models to dedicated accounts
- **Provider Mixing**: Combine Antigravity, Codex, GitHub Copilot, and Zed in custom flows
- **Fallback Chains**: Automatic failover when primary accounts hit rate limits

### How It Works

```
Request
  ├─ Provider-native model → Account Routing → Account chain → Provider → Upstream API
  └─ Custom model/route:flow → Flow Routing → Flow entries → Provider → Upstream API

No match → 400 error
```

### Configuration

1. **Access Panel**: `http://localhost:8964/routing`
2. **Flow Routing**: Create a flow (e.g., "fast", "opus"), add Provider → Account → Model entries
3. **Account Routing**: Choose a provider-native model, set account order, optionally enable Smart Switch
4. **Use Flow**: Set `model` to `route:<flow-name>` or the flow name directly
5. **Use Provider-native Model**: Request the provider-native model ID directly (e.g., `claude-sonnet-4-5`)

**Example Request**:
```json
{
  "model": "route:fast",
  "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}]
}
```

**Flow Priority**: Entries are tried in order. If an account hits 429, the next entry is used.
**Account Routing**: If Smart Switch is on and no explicit entries exist, it expands to all supporting accounts in creation order.

---

## Remote Access

Expose your local Anti-API to the internet for cross-device access. Useful for:

- **Mobile Development**: Test AI integrations on iOS/Android
- **Authorized cross-device access**: Connect environments administered by the same user or organization through the authenticated inference-only gateway; do not share personal subscriptions or credentials.
- **External Tools**: Connect AI tools that require public URLs

### Supported Tunnels

| Tunnel | Account Required | Stability | Speed |
|--------|------------------|-----------|-------|
| **ngrok** | Provider-dependent | Managed third-party tunnel | Fast setup |
| **cloudflared** | No | Good | Medium |
| **localtunnel** | No | Fair | Slow |

### Setup

1. **Access Panel**: `http://localhost:8964/remote-panel`
2. **Configure** (ngrok only): Enter your authtoken from [ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com)
3. **Start Tunnel**: Click Start, wait for public URL
4. **Use Remote URL**: Replace `localhost:8964` with the tunnel URL

**Security Note**: Anyone with your tunnel URL can access your API. Keep it private.

## Settings Panel

Configure application behavior at `http://localhost:8964/settings`:

- **Auto-open Dashboard**: Open quota panel on startup
- **Auto-start ngrok**: Start tunnel automatically
- **Model Preferences**: Set default models for background tasks

- **增强包管理器保护** - Homebrew / WinGet 安装不再自覆盖更新，而是分别提示使用 `brew upgrade anti-api` 和 `winget upgrade anti-api`

</details>

<details>
<summary>v2.8.0</summary>

- **新增 Zed 托管模型支持** - Anti-API 现在可以导入已授权的 Zed 账号，并将请求路由到 Zed 提供的模型
- **按账号动态拉取模型** - Routing 会从每个可用的 Codex 和 Copilot 账号实时拉取模型，并加入 Zed 的账号级模型同步
- **明确 Zed 账号边界** - Zed 账号可以逐个导入并保存在 Anti-API 中，但不能像 Codex/Copilot 一样自动批量发现
- **更新 Zed 配额卡片** - Zed 卡片改为展示共享的 all models 支持状态和订阅周期时间，不再用误导性的剩余额度百分比
- **增强 Zed 稳定性** - 为 Zed 的账号读取、模型同步和 completion 请求增加了超时控制与成功后状态恢复

## 特性

- **Flow + Account 路由** - 自定义流控制非官方模型，官方模型使用账号链
- **六家 Provider** - Antigravity、ChatGPT Codex、GitHub Copilot、Zed 托管模型、Amazon Kiro、xAI Grok
- **远程访问** - ngrok/cloudflared/localtunnel 一键设置
- **仅推理公共网关** - 独立且必须 token 鉴权的远程监听器；面板、凭证、日志、设置和更新器保持私有
- **完整面板** - 配额监控、路由配置、设置面板
- **冷却感知故障转移** - 账号选择器保留粘性游标，并在额度、认证、404、429 或临时上游错误后循环切换
- **双格式支持** - OpenAI 和 Anthropic API 兼容
- **工具调用** - 支持 function calling，兼容 Claude Code
- **多模态请求** - 在兼容的 provider 适配器之间校验并传递文本、图片、工具和流式内容

## Zed 账号说明

- **仅显式导入** - 将 `ANTI_API_ZED_CREDENTIALS_FILE` 设置为绝对路径、仅所有者可读的 JSON 文件，再点击 `Add Account -> Zed`。Anti-API 不会扫描 Zed.app、Keychain 或其他应用数据库。
- **凭据格式** - 文件不得超过 64 KiB，并包含 `{"type":"zed","id":"...","access_token":"..."}`；未知字段会被忽略。Unix 下请使用 `chmod 600`。
- **固定服务地址** - 导入账号固定使用 Zed 身份服务 `https://zed.dev` 与 hosted API `https://cloud.zed.dev`；请求体不能覆盖这两个地址。
- **凭据过期** - Zed 源 access token 按原样导入。若请求返回 `401` 或 `403`，请更新凭据文件并使用 `Add Account -> Zed` 重新导入；Anti-API 不会扫描或自动刷新其他应用的凭据。
- **多账号** - 在 Zed 中切换已获授权的账号，为每个账号准备凭据文件后逐个导入；已导入账号会保存在 Anti-API 中。
- **额度监控** - Zed hosted models 共用同一个月度消耗池，面板展示 hosted access 状态和订阅周期，不显示精确剩余美元额度。

## 快速开始

### Windows

双击 `start.bat` 启动。
启动失败时窗口会保留，方便查看错误；只有无人值守脚本才应设置 `ANTI_API_NO_PAUSE=1`。

仓库内已经补齐 WinGet 打包与 manifest 生成链路。待 `winget-pkgs` 合并后，可直接使用：

```powershell
winget install anti-api
anti-api
```

安装完成后，在任意终端输入 `anti-api` 会直接启动服务。

### Linux

```bash
# 安装依赖
bun install

# 启动服务（默认端口：8964）
bun run src/main.ts start
```

### macOS

双击 `start.command` 启动。

### Docker

构建：

```bash
docker build -t anti-api .
```

运行：

```bash
export ANTI_API_CONTROL_TOKEN='replace-with-a-long-random-secret'

docker run --rm -it \
  -p 127.0.0.1:8964:8964 \
  -p 127.0.0.1:1455-1465:1455-1465 \
  -p 127.0.0.1:51121-51131:51121-51131 \
  -e ANTI_API_CONTAINER_CONTROL_PLANE=1 \
  -e ANTI_API_CONTROL_TOKEN="$ANTI_API_CONTROL_TOKEN" \
  -e ANTI_API_DATA_DIR=/app/data \
  -e ANTI_API_NO_OPEN=1 \
  -e ANTI_API_OAUTH_NO_OPEN=1 \
  -e ANTI_API_PACKAGE_MANAGER=docker \
  -e ANTI_API_NO_SELF_UPDATE=1 \
  -v $HOME/.anti-api:/app/data \
  anti-api
```

Compose：

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

开发覆盖模式（不重建，直接使用本地 `src/` 与 `public/`）：

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d --no-build
```

说明：
- Docker 控制面要求设置 `ANTI_API_CONTROL_TOKEN`；首次打开面板时使用 `http://localhost:8964/quota?control_token=<你的Token>` 完成一次性引导，随后地址栏中的参数会被移除并写入 HttpOnly Cookie。不要分享或公开这个 URL。
- OAuth 回调使用 `51121-51131`（Antigravity）和 `1455-1465`（Codex 浏览器 OAuth），请确保已映射这些端口。
- 如果运行在远程主机，请使用 `ssh -L 8964:localhost:8964 -L 51121:localhost:51121 user@host` 转发端口，并在服务器上设置 `ANTI_API_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URL=http://127.0.0.1:51121/oauth-callback` 后再发起登录。
- Docker 镜像会在容器内启用回调中继（`ANTI_API_DOCKER_OAUTH_CALLBACK=1`），但宿主机映射仍必须绑定 `127.0.0.1`；不要把 OAuth 回调端口发布到公网。
- 显式设置 `ANTI_API_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URL` 后，程序只会监听该 URL 指定的回环回调端口。两个流程都会校验登录 state，Antigravity 还使用 PKCE；公网回调地址仍会被拒绝，不要将授权码经过公网 HTTP 监听器传输。
- 挂载 `~/.anti-api` 后，Docker 会复用本地账号和路由配置。
- 本地导入类 provider 默认看不到宿主机凭据；如需导入，请按 `docker-compose.yml` 里的注释示例挂载 `.codex`、`.cli-proxy-api`、`.aws`、Kiro CLI 或 Amazon Q 目录。
- 设置 `ANTI_API_NO_OPEN=1` 可避免容器内尝试自动打开浏览器。
- Docker 内禁用面板自更新，请使用 `docker compose up -d --build` 重建或拉取镜像更新。
- 如果受限网络下 Copilot TLS 失败，可设置 `ANTI_API_COPILOT_INSECURE_TLS=1`（不建议常规使用）。
- 如果受限网络下 Codex TLS 失败，可设置 `ANTI_API_CODEX_INSECURE_TLS=1`（不建议常规使用）。
- 可通过 `ANTI_API_CODEX_REASONING_EFFORT=low|medium|high` 设置 Codex 默认推理强度（默认 `medium`）。
- 默认只记录错误。设置 `ANTI_API_LOG_LEVEL=error|warn|info|debug` 或 `ANTI_API_DEBUG=1` 可增加诊断日志；日志不会输出凭据文件内容。
- Antigravity 使用当前客户端版本兜底，并会定期刷新公开版本清单；可设置 `ANTIGRAVITY_IDE_VERSION` 固定版本，或设置 `ANTI_API_DISABLE_ANTIGRAVITY_VERSION_REFRESH=1` 禁用刷新。
- 如果 Docker Hub 不稳定，默认基础镜像已使用 GHCR；可用 `BUN_IMAGE=oven/bun:1.3.5` 覆盖。
- 镜像内已为 Linux amd64/arm64 安装 ngrok。

## 智能路由系统 (Beta)

> **测试功能**：路由系统为实验性功能，配置格式可能在未来版本中变更。

路由系统拆分为两种模式：

- **Flow 路由**：自定义模型 ID（如 `route:fast`）使用流配置
- **Account 路由**：官方模型 ID（如 `claude-sonnet-4-5`）使用账号链

由此实现模型到账号的精细控制：

- **获授权账号选择** - 在本人拥有或获授权管理的账号之间选择路由
- **模型专用** - 指定模型使用专用账号
- **混合提供商** - 组合 Antigravity、Codex、Copilot、Zed
- **遵守冷却的故障转移** - 在配额、认证或短暂上游失败后，仅在获授权账号中按冷却时间选择

### 工作流程

```
请求
  ├─ 官方模型 → Account 路由 → 账号链 → 提供商 → 上游 API
  └─ 自定义模型/route:flow → Flow 路由 → 流条目 → 提供商 → 上游 API

无匹配 → 400 错误
```

### 配置方法

1. **访问面板**: `http://localhost:8964/routing`
2. **Flow 路由**: 创建流（如 "fast", "opus"），添加 提供商 → 账号 → 模型 条目
3. **Account 路由**: 选择官方模型，配置账号顺序，按需开启 Smart Switch
4. **使用流**: 设置 `"model": "route:<流名称>"` 或直接使用流名
5. **使用官方模型**: 直接请求官方模型 ID（如 `claude-sonnet-4-5`）

**Flow 顺序**：按配置顺序尝试，429 时切换下一个。
**Account 路由**：Smart Switch 仅在获授权账号集合内展开；不会为规避限制创建或聚合账号。

---

## 远程访问

将本地 Anti-API 暴露到公网，支持跨设备访问：

- **移动开发** - iOS/Android 测试 AI 集成
- **获授权的跨设备访问** - 通过带认证、仅提供推理功能的网关连接同一用户或组织管理的环境；不得共享个人订阅或凭证。
- **外部工具** - 连接需要公网 URL 的 AI 工具

### 隧道对比

| 隧道 | 需要账号 | 稳定性 | 速度 |
|------|----------|--------|------|
| **ngrok** | 是（免费层） | 最佳 | 快 |
| **cloudflared** | 否 | 良好 | 中 |
| **localtunnel** | 否 | 一般 | 慢 |

### 设置方法

1. **访问面板**: `http://localhost:8964/remote-panel`
2. **配置** (ngrok): 输入 [ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com) 的 authtoken
3. **启动隧道**: 点击启动，等待公网 URL
4. **使用远程 URL**: 用隧道 URL 替换 `localhost:8964`

**安全提示**: 隧道是第三方服务，仅应暴露带 `ANTI_API_PUBLIC_TOKEN` 的推理网关；面板、日志、设置、账号与更新器保持本机访问。

## 设置面板

访问 `http://localhost:8964/settings` 配置：

- **自动打开面板**: 启动时打开配额面板
- **自动启动 ngrok**: 自动启动隧道
- **模型偏好**: 设置后台任务默认模型
